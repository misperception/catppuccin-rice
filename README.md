# catppuccin-rice

Custom widgets for my Windows 10 Catppuccin themed rice.

All credits for the music player widget go to [dule23](https://www.deviantart.com/dule23) on DeviantArt, check out their stuff!

## Installation

Download the .rmskin file for the widgets you want in the [releases](https://github.com/misperception/catppuccin-rice/releases/latest) page.

You will need to configure your music player of choice when you install the music player widget. If you use Spotify, this has already been done for you. For any other players, edit the `styles.inc` file at `catppuccin_music\@Resources` to include your choice. For a list of supported players, check out <https://wnp.keifufu.dev/desktop-players#list-of-supported-players>.
